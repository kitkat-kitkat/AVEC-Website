to whichever poor av student ended up here, i wish you the best of luck, and i send you my apologies.
i programmed this site in 2 days, even i can't find my way around the code. 
my advice? pray to your god if you believe in one, and book a therapist if you don't. 
you're gonna need all the help you can get.
